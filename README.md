# Spiders

## About

This is a project to practice writing Scrapy based crawlers. Every project has a seperate directory and been tested by myself. Some projects relays on Scrapy-Splash which is a lightweight browser. It can render javascripts and get back a dynamic generated html. For these projects, users should have Splash and Scrapy-Splash installed in advance.
